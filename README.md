# World_Weather_Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to use world weather APIs and Google's developer APIs to take user input and find vacation spots with ideal weather.

## Overview

We created ideal vacation spots in three steps. First, we created code (Weather Database) that generated random longitudes and latitudes to find hotels in the nearby area. Second, we allowed users to input their desired temperature range (Vacation Search) , with a minimum and maximum. With this given range we would limit our ideal city and hotel search to their specifications. Lastly, we created a custom itinerary code (Vacation Itinerary) to provide a sample group of cities to travel between, complete with google maps generate directions between cities and custom markers that displayed relevant information such as city, country, hotel information, weather conditions, and temperature.
